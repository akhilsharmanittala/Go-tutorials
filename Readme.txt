Hi, this repo is for go lang tutorials with examples learnt from the ceritification course from udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/go-data-structures-algorithms-and-design-patterns-with-go/learn/lecture/13351522#overview

executio of go programming language:
> go run hello.go ---> this will run the code in hello.go and generates output on the console
> go build hello.go ---> this will compile the code and generates a binary but do not print any output on the console


if you want to print the output of the binary execute the binary like ./hello

binary usually more in size compared to the actual go file.
